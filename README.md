# Contributions Tracker

Displays a graph of the logged in user’s GitHub contributions ([demo],
[static demo]).

[![](docs/screenshot.png)][demo]

If the request is made to the frontend base URL, it will show the contributions
for the user currently logged into GitHub. If there is a username after the base
URL, it will show the contributions for that GitHub user.

## Modes

- **Authenticated.** This is the default mode that requires the user to be
  authenticated with GitHub in order to see data. Handled by [`index.html`]
  ([demo]).
- **Static.** The same interfaces as authenticated mode, but it loads the data
  from a file on the server (generated by [`scripts/generate-static.ts`]).
  Handled by [`static.html`] ([demo][static demo]).
- **Compact.** Suitable for embedding in another page. This just shows the
  contribution graph without the repository list or the pop-overs. Handled by
  [`compact.html`] ([demo][compact demo]).

## Configuration

Configuration of the frontend is via environment variables when running
`deno run dev` or `deno run build`:

- `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: The GitHub client ID for this app (from
  [GitHub OAuth app settings]).
- `VITE_FRONTEND_URL`: The app’s homepage (needs to match
  [GitHub OAuth app settings]).
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: Defaults to `$VITE_FRONTEND_URL`. This is the URL prefix
  for API calls, e.g. `$VITE_BACKEND_URL/api/health`. Note that the default
  backend (in [`backend/`]) does not support
  [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing][CORS], so usually this cannot reference a
  different host than `$VITE_FRONTEND_URL`. It doesn’t have to have a scheme and
  host specified, e.g. `/` is acceptable.
- `VITE_CONTRIBUTIONS_URL`: Defaults to `assets/contributions.json`. Compact and
  static modes load contributions data from this URL.
- `VITE_CLICK_URL`: If this is set, clicking the graph in compact mode will
  navigate to this URL.

For development, create a `.env` file (see [.env.example]) for convenience.

The backend takes configuration as command line parameters or environment
variables:

- `--bind IP:PORT` or `BIND`: the address and port to bind to.
- `--github-client-id STRING` or `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: The GitHub client ID for
  this app (from [GitHub OAuth app settings]).
- `--github-client-secret` or `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: The GitHub client secret
  for this app (from [GitHub OAuth app settings]).

The backend should be proxied through the frontend URL at `/api`, e.g. a request
to `http://frontend/api/health` should be proxied to
`http://backend/api/health`.

## Stack

This is a TypeScript and React app with a simple Rust backend built on
[Dropshot]. Dropshot provides automatic OpenAPI support, which enables
compile-time type checking of calls across the API boundary.

## To do

- [ ] Load information about local repositories in backend.

### Likely incompatible

- **Systemd socket activation.** Dropshot takes a `SocketAddr` as configuration
  then binds a `TcpListener`. In order to use [systemd socket activation], e.g.
  with [systemd_socket], we need to pass Dropshot an already bound
  `TcpListener`, or some sort of generic that supports
  `systemd_socket::SocketAddr`. This would require changes to Dropshot.
